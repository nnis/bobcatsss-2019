## Abstract
Background: Museums, as part of the information infrastructure, play an important role in the society. They are bridging the past, the present and the future. Nowadays museums have to re-evaluate their approaches to visitors in order to thrive and to remain relevant to the public. Museums need to be innovative in how to communicate topics connected with culture heritage. With increasing frequency, new media, other technologies and different participation strategies are used for building information environment and functional communities around the museums.

Aims and methods: The purpose of this article is to examine how are Czech museums reflecting special needs of visitors based on their preferred communication type. Based on psychological, biological and neurolingvists theories four communication types, **H**aptic-social, **I**ntellectual, **V**isual, **A**uditive, were compare with different presentation techniques used in exhibitions expecting authentic object and with accompanying programs.

The article presents data from a quantitative questionnaire survey conducted in 2015. The questionnaire included thirteen questions, for this article was used two of them; question about different types of display forms and offered accompanying programs. In total, 203 Czech museums have provided answers. In the same year, 486 museums had filled the official report for the nationwide cultural statistics so the article reports about nearly 42 % of all Czech museums.

Results: DOPSAT!!!!

Conclusions: The presented work is the first known original research into this topic in the context of the Czech Republic. The work sets a baseline for monitoring of innovation in the Czech museums and clearly implies where are the greatest possibilities for innovation.

## Introduction

Museums are important for society in many ways. They help people to understand the world around them, to experience themselves by participating in many different situations and by exploring maybe unexpected topics. They allow us to meet the world which has passed away by centuries but it is still present in our vision and in ways in which we are thinking about nowadays. And last but not least (Tanner et al., 2005) they are preparing people for future. Each institution has to find its specific role, vision, purpose and way how to be relevant to the concrete public and furthermore the only one right way or a simple recipe does not exists. Fulfilling these noble ideas is a long-term strategy which is composed of large number of activities. The main and the most visible communication platform for museums are exhibitions which is discussed in these paper and accompanying programs which are perfect to cover more special goals, concrete or advanced topics for specific group of visitors from layman to experts. Visitors like to be part of the things, they like to be in the middle of action and they want to absorb meaningful content which has been prepared for their individual needs and preferences (Simon, 2010). The unique learning potential is object based learning (Vayne, 2012) which can be manifested trough accompanying programs.

A history of museums, in other words a history of the systematic collecting objects, has begun 3 000 years B.C. in Ancient Egypt. The phenomenon of collecting has changed over the centuries through several significant stages like Antique collectible, Medieval treasures collections, over the era of cabinets to the 19th century where the modern museums were established (Holman, 2010). In short these modern museums were focused on the objects themselves, care of the collection and on scientific and systematic development of the collection. During the last few decades we can reveal two fundamental shifts. The first change was meant turn attention from object to observer so the exhibitions started to be *for someone* not only be *about something*. During this process of change the museum has started to be more visitor-centred (Polly and Janet, 2013). The adaptation of the idea of visitor-centred museums evolves gradually to the second significant shift which affects current standards in creating museums. The visitor has transformed into collaborator so the visit is thenceforth connected with *dialogue, partnership, equality, openness, interpretation, open-ended stories* etc. This change brings the need of re-definition deep attitudes of museums and has plenty of practical implications which have been accustomed to be the static and authoritative organisations (Simon, 2010) These shifts are also connected with the need of more balanced economical situation of museums regarding to high competition in leisure time activities (Camareroa et al., 2014).

### Innovation in museums
Different occasions like changes in society and the expectations of visitors, financial needs, growing competition with mass culture conduced to think about changes in museums itself. Part of museums have started to change and innovate the exhibitions by adding multimedia, technological displays and interactive activities, other part went back to displaying in conventional manner (Sklenář et al., 2017) to support traditional purpose of museums - meet the authentic objects (Midgley, Henderson, 2005).  According to Camarero et al. (2014) the situation in museums is connected with the "economy of experience" whereas experience is define as "memorable events that engage each customer in an inherently personal way". These high demands flow into necessity of innovation. Innovation in museums can be divided into two parts. In the first one is the innovation connected with exhibition design and developing long-term partner relationship with visitors who come to museum repeatedly and during each visit they can find something new and find opportunities to personal grow. On the other part the innovation is related with organizational procedures, management structures, style of leading people, project management (Polly and Janet, 2013) and of course with way how the professionals think about the institution (Camareroa et al., 2014). Doesn't matter which way of innovation we will choose, we need to create information environment where visitors will be equal part of a dialogue which is held during the visit or special event for this reason we have to focus to visitor's communication type.

### The Exhibition
The main, the most specific, significant and visible way how museums communicate, educate, entertain visitors and present cultural heritage are exhibitions. The exhibition can be define in many ways depending on the particular point of view and related field like a pedagogy, an information science, a media studies, an art, a history, a psychology etc. Accordingly, the one of the obvious thing is that the exhibition is multilayered and one universally accepted definition does not exists. For purpose of this paper the exhibition is understand as a medium - in accordance to Šobáňová (2014) in the meaning as education medium and Maure (1995) three-dimensional medium - because the main purpose of the exhibition is *to mediate* or to communicate (Dernie, 2006) knowledge about the world through the concrete space where authentic objects, different types of displays, media and designed scene are placed. Furthermore the exhibition should be designed as satisfying, educational and valuable museum experience (Simon, 2010; Doering, 2010).

### The context of the Czech republic
The Czech republic is a landlocked country in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast. This paper describes situation of Czech museums during the 2015. Current state of museums is rooted in the political situation and socio-economic aspects of the 20th century history. In 1946 there were approximately 360 museums and monuments where about 4 millions specimens were hold. The Communist Party was ruling in Czechoslovakia from 1948 to 1989. During the 1950s many museums were made improper use of communist agenda and propaganda and history facts were falsified. The unblocking and aspiration to emancipate museums from political control during 1960s was stopped by occupation by Russian army in 1968. The next twenty years called "Normalisation" were devastating; Czech museums got behind the European scene particularly in technical, material and spatial fitments and in providing services to visitors. On the contrary the amount of museum objects have increased to around 60 millions in 1989 which is 15 times more than in 1946. After the Velvet revolution and fall of communist regime in 1989 the Czech museums had to start dealing with the heritage of decades before and trying to find new attitudes in a democratic society (Žalman, 2002).

### Communication types
Communication types play an important role in many areas which is connected with communication - relationships, business, art, marketing, medical services and also for museums. The theories about communication types is rooted in psychology, pedagogy and also in neuro-biology and different authors has a bit dissimilar segmentation of people by communication types. Neorolingvists such as Knihgt has divided people into three main categories - visual, auditive and emotional. A neurolingvistic programming (NLP) is based on the main idea that we get information through all of the senses and than we code, execute and combine information in our minds in a specific way based on a pattern of thinking. Understanding ways of perception and thinking allow us understand people, different cultures and also the history (Knight, 2009). Vester (1999) focused in his work on the thinking, learning and ability to remember information. Vester starts with biological consequences (specialized parts of brains, neurons, hormones etc.), main principles of a memory (ultra-short-term, short-term and long-term memory) and makes conclusions important for schools based on set of factors connected with understanding of information and another set of factors connected with remembering because of different brain functions is involved. Finally he defines four or five main communication types: verbal, haptic, visual, auditive and maybe communicative type. The needs of the main communication types have to have teachers in mind when they teach and each topic should be presented in five different ways. As we said one of the main purpose of museums is to mediate knowledge, to engage visitors in different topics by designing special information environment as exhibitions and accompanying programs are. Finally Vester has pointed out that we have to stop thinking in terms as good, bad, clever, dumb or lazy student (visitor), we have to ask if our learning environment is designed with respect to different communication types.

Along with Vester (1999), Knight (2009) and knowledge about museums four communication types were defined:
1. **H**aptic-social type
2. **I**ntellectual type
3. **V**isual type
4. **A**uditive type

It is need to be said in summary that the clear type does not exist but one of the type is always dominant, another is supplemental and other consequences like a theme of learning, surrounding, current emotional state play role as well. The effect of the each learning session, doesn't matter where it's in a class or in the museum, is composed of many different aspects. Connection between exhibition design and communication types is bellow.

## Purpose of the study and methods
The aim of the study is to analyse connection between different communication types and presentation forms used in exhibition design and forms of accompanying programs. This paper answer one hypothesis: To what scale the needs of visitors to Czech museums are taken into account due to their communication type.

Quantitative survey (https://goo.gl/3auEyj) has been chosen as a method. Online survey made in Goggle forms started to be distributed on 6th June 2015. The institutions were asked for participating via e-mail. The addresses were used from publicly available address list on the website of Czech Association of Museums and Galleries (http://www.cz-museums.cz/adresar/). The list consists of more than 800 contacts which have been reached out but only near to 500 contacts are proper museums, other is related institutions as monuments, zoos, information centres, schools, museology teachers or university departments. 109 filled surveys were established at first but we want to have at least 150 questionnaires so during the November 2015 we asked for participating again. After removing duplicates, 203 responses were obtained overall.

Questionnaire includes 13 questions; five from them were dedicated to gain information about institution itself (number of employees, the main group of visitors etc.), rest of the questions were dedicated for obtain information about exhibitions, accompanying programs and online communication. For this analyse questions 1 and 4 were used. Data was anonymized and proceeded in programming language Python.

### Characteristics of the sample

A total sample includes 203 museums. According to instructions the survey should been filled by the employ who is responsible for exhibition realization. For examine representatives the sample was compared with the official cultural statistic annually made by The National Information and Consulting Centre for Culture (NIPOS). Museums can be divided by variant characteristics - an amount of objects in the collections, square meters of exhibition area, amount of visitors per year, theme of the museum etc. An amount of employees has been chosen as the main factor for this paper because human resources is crucial for a way how the institution is managed. An institution with higher amount of employees will probably have a innovation, communication or educational specialist. As a small museum is define the institution with 1-10 employees, as medium size 11-25 and big institutions have more than 26.

Accordingly to the official cultural statistic from NIPOS there were 486 museums in 2015 (NIPOS, 2016). Considering the amount of employees, the situation is covered by chart 1, in both samples 65 % of museums are small, in NIPOS sample medium size museum is 16 % counter to 17,3 % in the sample and in NIPOS sample big museums is 18,9 % as opposed to 17,7 % in the sample. Thus the sample is representative enough. The main target group of visitors, not necessarily the most numerous one, in all museums are school groups and tourists.

### Types of displays and accompanying programs connected with different communication styles

Following part is explaining a link between museum presentation techniques and different communication types. To clarify, the partition is a bit rough because in each unique display or learning session depends on the specific design, dramaturgical concept and peculiar goal. The ulterior distribution of museum displays and techniques are based on traditional and majority use in museums and the meaning is explained.

1. **H**aptic-social type
These people have best learning experiences and results from teaching based on doing things, they need to touch, feel and be deep inside the activity. They need enough time to practical testing and for an appreciation of sensational. For haptical-social type is important a sharing knowledge, cooperation and learning from another people trough communication. It is also important that they need to feel accepted from others and for this type is extremely important the whole atmosphere of the learning session and sense of safety.

Museums displays and activities for **H** type:
* Music (Adding atmosphere, work on emotions like in movies)
* 3D objects (Hands-on activities)
* Visit based on narrative story with main character (Visitors can identify with a character and live the topic through the character)
* Games (Especially co-operative games)
* Workshops (Allow to be part of the situation in many ways suitable for H type)
* Family programs (Are often design as a opportunity to share intergenerational experiences and for "being together" in museums).
2. **I**ntellectual type
Intellectual types have well developed abstract and conceptual thinking; they are concentration trained the most counter to other types. They are tending to absorb information formed into logical structures such as charts, numbers, tables, they are good in analysing texts. They need concrete information, details and to divide task into particular parts connected in logical process. They learn much more as individuals so they do not need a co-worker.

Museums displays and activists for **I** type:
* Information panels (Panels include text, charts and structured information designed for individual coming through)
* Handleable texts (Structured information and facts designed for individual coming through)
* Visualisation (Especially that one with logical or chronological data)
* Comic (Stories divided into separate parts which are logical following and contain detail information)
* Touch sreens (Visitor as individual go through information on his own. Touch screens mainly contain text, pictures, detail information)
* Games (Especially quizzes and logical games)
* Lecture and discussion (Especially lectures because they are well structured and presented by a specialist with expertise)
* Visit with working sheets (When the working sheets are designed in logical steps and allow explore topic through tasks.)

3. **V**isual type
V types think in images, at first they need a whole image of the topic without details which are disturbing for them. They think fast by creating an image in their head, they easy to be a visionary but if they don't have good input information they can make false pictures about reality. They need information structured by colouring, underline, different fonts. The exposure of information has to be dynamic, strong, colourful, expressive, tame situation does not impress V types. They are creative and they need various and not boring activities.

Museums displays and activists for **V** type:
* Information panels (Especially images and charts)
* Video (Offer an image of situation)
* Visualisation (Especially if they are present by colours, charts and visual attractive way)
* Comics: (Information are composed from pictures)
* Touch screens (Often offer images)
* 3D objects (Deep examination support big image of the topic)
* Videomapping (Very immersive display with imaginative pictures)
* Visit with working sheets (Especially when working sheets are graphically rich)

4. **A**uditive type
A types prefer audio sources of information, they don't need to watch the speaker and they don't need to make notes because what they hear they are able to remember. A types are able to listen much more longer in contrast with other types and they also like to speak a lot. Simultaneously making things when they listen is disturbing and ends in less remembered information. For A type is also important the environment, especially the noise level - they need quite or music which they choose.

Museums displays and activities for **A** type:
* Audio (Spoken comment is best source for A type)
* Music (Music, sounds)
* Video (Especially the video comment and sounds)
* Lecture and discussion (Offer opportunity to listen and speak)

## Results
Respondents in two multioptional questions marked all of the forms of displays and types of accompanying programs thus the list of used forms was settled. We focused on supplemental displays and events not on authentic objects themselves. Due to explanation above some forms are suitable for more then one type. This list was divided by four communication types. The ideal museum which equal respect all types and do not prefer anyone would have distribution as 25 % for each type. The examination showed that Czech museums are for **H** type in 17.6%, for **I** in 31.3%, for **V** in 32.3% and for **A** 18.8%. Not only for visual types the results is presented in a chart 2. The results were examined also for specific groups of the sample (small contrary middle and big museums, modernizes museums or small modernized museums) but the results were not significantly different.

## Discussion
It is not so unexpected that the most represented communication type in museums is a visual type (32,3 %). The determination for visual types would rise much more if also authentic object would be ranked as a form of display. Understanding to authentic objects in intellectual or haptic-social way is a inconsistent because it is not allowed to touch the objects, many of specimens have lost their primary function (Šobáňová and Lažová, 2016) thus they are often not understandable for visitors because they have no idea what they watch on (Šebek, 2010). For this reason the primary way how most of the visitors access to objects is how it looks, if they like it, if it is big, small, broken or maybe expensive. The object could be a source of fact information only for very advanced visitors or experts.

The second most represented is the intellectual type but it's a question if most of the visitors are **I** types. Vester (1999) describes situation with textbooks for school which are produced mostly by **I** types scientist and experts and the parallel with texts in exhibition can be found. Furthermore the production and costs of displays is important part of exhibition design and making text is less expensive than production of events with the need of special accessories or displays which need to run on special hardware and software. Text are easily to be produced by museum professionals themselves and they do not need co-operate with other specialist who have to be paid. Based on question 2 where we asked responders to scale what visitors do during the visit on scale *not at all-a bit-middle-significantly-dominantly*, the reading texts fit into the group of actions which are done *a bit* in contrast to clearly preferred examining objects and listening to the guide.

Auditive type is respected on 18,8 % but the number would be higher if we count a guide tours which were taken for granted so they aren't as a option in survey. Traditionally visitors can reserve a special tour with a guide on demand.

The less represented communication type is haptic-social type with 17,7 % but just these types of displays, offered activities and special visits based on object stories (Vayne, 2012) are the unique opportunity for museums to be different from other leisure time activities (Polly and Janet, 2013) All of **H** forms can be understand as synonymous to museum where visitor is a collaborator or participant on the museum life. Design museum visit based on co-operation and like a potency to meet strangers or meet with family or friends beyond unexpected themes what leads to know ourselves and other people better is more important for teenagers  and for school groups (Simon,2010) Moreover if the main target group are school groups and tourists which are full of expectations to gain interesting experiences.

## Conclusion

This paper has presented theme of an innovations in museum exhibition design and accompanying programs through the connection with different visitor's needs represented by communication types. At the first sight the results should not be surprising but in a deeper perspective of changed paradigm in museums, it is clear that Czech museums do not particularly fulfilling the needs of **H** and **A** type whereas the **H** type activities and displays are in agreement with standards and expectations of the public.
